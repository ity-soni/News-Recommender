This project aims to build a news article recommendation system using the TFIDF technique. TFIDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, which is a numerical measure that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents. By using TFIDF, the system can compare the similarity between different news articles based on their keywords and content. The system can then recommend the most relevant and interesting news articles to the users based on the current article.
